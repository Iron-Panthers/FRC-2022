    Todo:
        1. Make and initialize two motors
        2. Define functions in this subsystem to move the arm a direction
        3. Make a command ArmCommand.java that has handles moving the arm
        4. Define certain buttons to call command functions that move our arm some amount of degrees
            4a. We should have encoders to be able to move by degrees somehow
